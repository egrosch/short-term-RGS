Github repository for the paper "Selection strategies for short term recurrent genomic selection programs" by Grosch et al (2026). 

Avelbility of genetic markers allowed the use of recurrent genomic selection in plant breeding.
However, first applications showed a higher genetic short-term gain while diversity and long-term
success got lost. Taggling this tradeoff, newer strategies focused on long-term success but
dramatically reduced short-term success. In our paper we investigated strategies in a short-term
breeding scheme looking for greater selection gain while preserving diversity. We simulated
different strategies on real oat and wheat datasets and compared genetic gain and genetic
diversity with the applied truncation selection strategy using random mating.

The necessary simulations were performed in RStudio using the SelectionTools software.  
The scripts for all strategies used are located in the strategies folder, and the files required for the data sets are located in the datasets folder.
